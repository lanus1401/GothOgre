A) Apply patches from this folder before.
To apply patch, use right-click on Ogre folder -> TortoiseHg 
-> Workbench -> Repository -> Import.

B) Run CMake (cmake-gui), set the parameters:
Where is the source code:    <Ogre>
Where to build the binaries: <Ogre>/VCbuild

Press the "Configure" button, then press the "Configure" button again, 
and press the "Generate" button.
The "Generate" button will create a solution <Ogre>/VCbuild/Ogre.sln.

C) Open solution <ogre>\VCbuild\ogre.sln, and build it.

D) Build the documentation (Ogre API Reference )
The "doc" project in the same solution can make documentation for Ogre3D in html formal.
To compile chm, open "<ogre>/VCbuild/api/html/index.hhp" with HTML Help WorkShop.
You'll get "<ogre>/VCbuild/api/html/OgreAPIReference.chm" as result.

E) Ensure you successfully have built Ogre3D. 
Go to folder "<ogre>/VCbuild/bin/Release" and run "SampleBrowser.exe". 
Go to folder "<ogre>/VCbuild/bin/Debug" and run "SampleBrowser_d.exe".
