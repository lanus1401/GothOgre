		/** Return an instance of user objects binding associated with this class.
		You can use it to associate one or more custom objects with this class instance.
		@see UserObjectBindings::setUserAny.		
		*/
		UserObjectBindings&	getUserObjectBindings() { return mUserObjectBindings; }

		/** Return an instance of user objects binding associated with this class.
		You can use it to associate one or more custom objects with this class instance.
		@see UserObjectBindings::setUserAny.		
		*/
		const UserObjectBindings& getUserObjectBindings() const { return mUserObjectBindings; }
