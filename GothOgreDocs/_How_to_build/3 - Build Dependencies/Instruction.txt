A) Apply patch from this folder to Ogre dependencies.
(TortoiseHg->Workbench->Repository->Import)

B) Run CMake (cmake-gui), set the parameters:
Where is the source code:    <OgreDeps>
Where to build the binaries: <OgreDeps>/VCbuild

Here <OgreDeps> means the directory with cloned Ogre dependencies' repository.

Press the "Configure" button, then press this button again, and press the "Generate" button.
The "Generate" button will create a solution <OgreDeps>/VCbuild/OgreDeps.sln.

C) Open solution <OgreDeps>\VCbuild\OGREDEPS.sln, and build it in the "Release" and "Debug"
configurations. 

D) Build project "INSTALL" in the solution also in the "Release" and "Debug"
configurations. 

E) Ensure you successfully built OgreDeps.
Go into the "<OgreDeps>\bin" folder and look at *.dll files 
(in "Debug" and "Release" subfolders) and 
then go into the "<OgreDeps>\lib" folder and look at *.lib files 
(also in "Debug" and "Release" subfolders).

F) Sets environment variable "OGRE_DEPENDENCIES_DIR" to the path to <OgreDeps> folder
(Use "My Computer Properties->Environment Variables").
This environment variable is used by Ogre to find dependencies.

G) (this item will be removed later) 
Copy all files from folder "<OgreDeps>\src\zziplib\zzip" to folder "<OgreDeps>\include\zzip".
