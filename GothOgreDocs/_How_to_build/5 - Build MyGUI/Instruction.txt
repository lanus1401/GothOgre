A) Apply patches from this folder.
(Right-click on the <MyGUI> folder, select TortoiseSVN -> apply Patch

B) Run CMake (cmake-gui), set the parameters:
Where is the source code:    <MyGUI>
Where to build the binaries: <MyGUI>/VCbuild

Press the "Configure" button, then set the following options:
set "MyGUI_DEPENDENCIES_DIR" to "<ogredeps>"
set "OGRE_BUILD" to "<ogre>\VCbuild"
set "MyGUI_BUILD_UNITTESTS" to true

It's useless to set "OGRE_INCLUDE_DIR" and "OGRE_LIB_DIR"
because likely there is a bug in the MyGUI cmake configurator.
There is an alternative way to set pathes -
via Visual Studio's settings. 
Add the following include pathes:
$(BOOST_ROOT)
$(OGRE_HOME)\OgreMain\include
$(OGRE_HOME)\VCbuild\include

and add the following lib pathes:
$(BOOST_ROOT)\stage\lib
$(OGRE_HOME)\VCbuild\lib\Debug
$(OGRE_HOME)\VCbuild\lib\Release

Press the "Configure" button again, and press the "Generate" button.
The "Generate" button will create a solution <MyGUI>/VCbuild/MyGUI.sln.

C) Open solution <MyGUI>\VCbuild\MyGUI.sln, and build it.

D) Build the documentation.
Build the "api-docs" project in the same solution to do that.
To compile chm, then open "<MyGUI>/VCbuild/api/index.hhp" with HTML Help WorkShop.
You'll get "<ogre>/VCbuild/Docs/html/OgreAPIReference.chm" as result.
i.e. file <MyGUI>/VCbuild/Docs/MyGUI.chm.

E) Ensure you successfully have built MyGUI. 
Go to folder "<MyGUI>/VCbuild/bin/Debug" and run demos and unit tests. 
Go to folder "<MyGUI>/VCbuild/bin/Release" and run demos and unit tests.
